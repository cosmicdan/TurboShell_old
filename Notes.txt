If I ever need a more "low-level" hook, I could use SetWindowsHookEx:
 - Probably more complicated - apparently I need to pass the message on
 - Performance is also a concern
Probably should only use this as an absolute last resort

Alternative, for keyboard/mouse hooking:

 - Unsure if I'll ever have a use for this, but nice to know it's possible
